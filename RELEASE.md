# Release

The release process requires a few steps.

1. Update the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/WhatsApp/erlfmt/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) file.
```
    ### v<major>.<minor>.<bugfix>

    Document features and Bug fixes since last release.
    See https://github.com/WhatsApp/erlfmt/releases/ for link to commits since last release.
    Add issue numbers or pull requests numbers using hashtags to the fixes and features

    If only bug fixes change the bug fix version
    If features were added change the minor version
    Major version changes should be a big conversation
```
2. Bump version in `erlfmt.app.src`
3. Create a pull request, with these two changes and include that this is a release in the commit message.
4. Wait until github action passes and merge.
5. Draft a new release https://github.com/WhatsApp/erlfmt/releases/new
```
    Tag Version: v<major>.<minor>.<bugfix>
    Release title: Pick most significant feature
    Description: Copy ChangeLog contents
```
6. Release to WhatsApp.
   This could include building with an older version of erlang.
   Here is an example of building with erlang version 22 on mac:
```bash
$ brew install erlang@22
$ rm -rf _build/
$ PATH="/usr/local/opt/erlang@22/bin:$PATH" rebar3 as release escriptize
# check that it runs with erlang version 22
$ PATH="/usr/local/opt/erlang@22/bin:$PATH" _build/release/bin/erlfmt -h
# check that it runs with current erlang version
$ _build/release/bin/erlfmt -h
```
7. Release to hex: `rebar3 hex publish`.
   If you have not used hex before, create `~/.config/rebar3/rebar.config` and include the contents `{plugins, [rebar3_hex]}`:
```
mkdir -p ~/.config/rebar3/ && echo "{plugins, [rebar3_hex]}." >> ~/.config/rebar3/rebar.config
```
