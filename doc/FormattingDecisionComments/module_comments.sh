echo "# Analysis: Number of percentages on module documentation"
echo "We have conducted a deeper analysis of the number of percentages used for module documentation. This is meant to guide our recommendation of the \`%%% % @format\` module pragma."

echo "## Methodology"
echo "We first isolated the comments located above the \`-module\` attribute and counted the number of blocks (as opposed to single lines)"
echo "for each number of percentage, this avoids skewing the results towards lengthy multi-line comment blocks. We also removed all \`%% @format\` headings to give a better representation of usage."
