# Analysis: Usage of Types of Comments

We have analysed comments in several code bases, looking at the following two factors:

  - The number of percentages symbols
  - Whether comments are standalone, following directly or aligned:
    * standalone: a comment is on its own line, with possibly whitespace, but no code.
    * following: a comment is on the same line as code, but only zero or one space is between it and the code.
    * aligned: a comment is on the same line as code, more than one space away from the code.
